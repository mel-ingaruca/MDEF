I’m an transdisciplinary explorer committed to creating design cultures of care, restoration and reciprocity with nature. My core paths of exploration are to engage with more-than-human agency in knowledge making, to collaborate with the agency of living systems in material processes of design and ultimately to design for mutual flourishing and multispecies cohabitation. To do so I explore a broad set of methods from sustainbility science, ethnographic research, system thinking, future studies among others.
