# I Context: A call from the mountains {: .master-title}

In modern cities, mountains are treated as objects. They are the background of human activities. Meanwhile in other non-western indigenous traditions mountains are subjects. In Andean worldviews, mountains are apus, spirits, montañas sagradas. They are animate, have personality, will and consciousness.  People speak to the mountain, a symbolic act that addresses the mountain as a subject with agency. In rituals of Pago a la Tierra, people give offerings to the land: corn, coca leaves, tabaco, animals, to show gratitude or ask for blessings. That is how they enact reciprocity with the land. Amid a growing interest in interspecies communication in the western world through technical and scientific methods, I wanted to explore interspecies communication with the mountains through intuition-led, affective and embodied modes of inquiry 

## Method: first-person research to communicate with the mountains

I adopted a first-person perspective to explore how interspecies communication with mountains might be practiced and understood. This methodological orientation emerged through reflection on my visits in 2025 to mountains in Peru and Japan that resonated deeply with me on emotional and spiritual levels. I became aware that I was already engaging in a form of interspecies communication during these visits, even though it was not explicitly framed as such at the time. From these encounters, I developed two design protocols through post-reflection, which allowed me to articulate early insights into interspecies communication. Building upon them, I later created a third protocol to explore communication with Montjuïc, a mountain in Barcelona. Together, these protocols function as both documentation and methodological tools for exploring how humans can engage in interspecies communication with mountains. 

## Protocol 1: mountains as kin

![protocol1](../images/protocol%20moutain%20as%20kin.jpg)

In early 2025, I visited the Peruvian mountains connected to my grandparents’ lineages in Satipo (Junín) and Huamanga (Ayacucho). These walks were conceived as acts of making kin with the mountains, and of reconnecting with landscapes that are inseparable from my family history.

This protocol functions as a ritual of communication intended to remember and re-activate the relationship between my human lineage and the mountains. It begun by visiting landscapes intertwined with family stories, sometimes accompanied by relatives and sometimes alone. A key practice is the conscious recollection of names—of family members and of the mountains themselves—as a way of situating oneself within a lineage that includes both human and more-than-human actors.
Upon entering the mountain, introducing oneself is an essential gesture of respect. I then asked the mountain for guidance in unveiling family history. As the walk unfolds, I situated myself within known family narratives and anecdotes while remaining attentive to the unknowns. As we enter deeper into the mountain, we trust we will get answers: emotionally charged encounters with biotic and abiotic elements are treated as messages. Some interactions trigger memories and stories shared by my grandparents; others provoke speculation and imaginative reconstruction. I understand this process as an archaeology of family memory. After sharing intimate and emotional moments with my family, we embraced mountains as kin. The feeling lingers even now. A practice to nurture this connection is talking to my human and mountain ancestors to ask for guardianship.
I chose this context as an example of interspecies communication because it is my heritage. The practice of speaking to mountains has been present in my family across generations. On my mother’s side, my grandmother Edith Cebrián used to sing to the mountains. At the age of fourteen, she left her life behind in the mountains of Huamanga (Ayacucho) to migrate to Lima, saying goodbye to the land and promising never to return—a promise she kept. In January 2025, some of her descendants, including myself, returned to these mountains for the first time. My grandfather Víctor Moreno maintained a deeply contemplative relationship with the land, often walking and meditating in the tropical mountains of Satipo. It was during one of these walks, on his 56th birthday, that he died in an accident when a loose tree fell on him. 
These narratives shape my understanding of mountains not as passive landscapes but as active participants in family history. Migration to the city has distanced my living family in Lima from the land, resulting in the loss of important practices of interspecies communication, such as Pago a la Tierra—an Andean ritual of reciprocity with the land. These visits revealed not only collective histories but also personal insights. The mountains offered responses that I later translated into creative expression, including two poems written during these encounters.

De lila a azul, <br>
un atardecer que me traspasa la piel. <br>
De 1934 al 2025, <br>
la sangre que nos recorre y que ha encontrado su camino de vuelta. <br>

Te fuiste a los 10 años de Ayacucho, <br>
y a los 75 años de este mundo, <br>
y nunca volviste a este atardecer, <br>
y yo, tan lejos me he ido antes de traerte de vuelta, <br>
algo de ti, <br>
la parte que vive en mí. <br>

Y aquí estoy en Ayacucho, mami, <br>
A veces Eduarda, <br>
A veces Rosa, <br>
A veces Edith Cebrián Rojas. <br>
Con el último nombre te conocí yo. <br>
Presumo, a veces, ser la nieta que más tiempo pasó contigo, <br>
pero que tan poco se de tu historia en Ayacucho. <br>
¿Por qué te fuiste de niña? <br>


Desenterramos recuerdos, una arqueologia emocional. Lo que queda al descubierto se siente como un nervio expuesto. Una injusticia sin rostro: el racismo-clasismo que mató a tu madre. Allá a inicios del siglo XX, Pedro Cebrián Matamoros, un mestizo con privilegios, se casó con Cirila Rojas. Una mujer muy hermosa, pero muy humilde según la recuerda la memoria familiar. El matrimonio fue mal visto, pero la sentencia llegaría el día del parto de tu hermano. La partera fue amenazada: si atendía a tu madre, nadie le daría más trabajo. No hay poesía que pueda maquillar la tragedia: Tu madre murió en el parto, y un remolino de dolor se llevó a tu padre también. Don Pedro se escondió en el alcohol. Semanas después, en un descuido, murió tu hermano de cólicos. En el cielo arde tu dolor. <br>

¿Cual atardecer te vio escapar? <br>

Prometiste no volver, pero nosotros hemos vuelto. Volvimos para sentir profundo. Para encontrar la lápida de tu padre con su nombre completito; y a tu madre enterrada debajo de la capilla del cementerio, “al fondo nomas”, sin lapida y sin nombre, con su historia anónima también en la memoria familar ¿Por qué mami? Nunca encontramos una foto suya. Mi mamá me ha contando, por primera vez, que tu la llamabas Lila. Sonrío. Es mi color favorito y siempre me rodea. <br>

Hoy la Lila del atardecer me abraza en esta montaña, con el calorcito del sol que ya se fue, que suavemente se despide. Aún estás conmigo, mami, suavemente abrazándome también. En Lila, siempre. <br>

Poem for my grandfather Victor Moreno
Satipo Mountains. February, 2025

Victor Moreno nació en La Libertad pero emigró 2 veces, la segunda a Satipo. Siempre sentí la relación con mi abuelo como intrascendente. El vivia lejos y mantenía una distancia emocional conmigo a la que me acostumbré. Pero fue él quien me regaló mis primeras memorias de la selva. Recuerdo mi primer viaje a Satipo en un bus interprovincial. De un lado, las estrellas a través de la ventana, y del otro, a mi mamá desmoronándose del soroche. Recuerdo el olor a la timolina, y su promesa de que ya vamos a llegar, hijita. Recuerdo despertar y ver esas montañas tan verdes por primera vez. Siempre las veo un poco en la memoria. Recuerdo mi incredulidad cuando me dijeron que cruzaría el río en un huaro, una tablita que colgaba de 4 cables de dudosa calidad.

Recuerdo el llano más arriba de las montañas donde vivía mi abuelo. Recuerdo secar cacao al sol. Y en las noches, la sopa con yuca frita. La oscuridad profunda. El cielo infinitamente habitado de estrellas. La vía láctea por primera vez. Lo recuerdo a él contando historias a la luz de la vela, historias de espíritus del monte, de reencarnación y otros eventos paranormales. Suspendida en sus historias, olvidaba la distancia que el territorio y, quizá mi abuelo mismo, habían puesto entre nosotros . Si mi abuelo alguna vez me dio algún consejo no lo recuerdo, pero él me dio la selva y las noches estrelladas.

Él murió el día de su cumpleaños. Caminaba por su chacra cuando un árbol le cayó encima. Tan casualmente. Por mucho tiempo cuestionamos esa historia con mi mamá ¿Cómo puede caer un árbol tan de repente? En febrero del 2025 volví a Satipo. Frente a la tumba de mi abuelo, le contaba a un amigo la historia del árbol, sin creerla aún. Al día siguiente, me encontraba en una comunidad Ashaninka, cuando un árbol cayó en el umbral de una puerta que solo segundos antes habían cruzado 2 personas. Y así, quizá por primera vez pensé en mi abuelo de forma trascendente. Sentí, quiza ingenuamente, pero certeramente, que era él, diciéndome, hijita ve y cuéntale a tu madre que fue un árbol, que fue la selva y solo ella que me llamó para llevarme adentro. Aquí estoy abuelo, pensé, creo que Satipo me está llamando también.

## Protocol 2: Self-Transcendence in the Mountains

![protocol2](../images/protocol%20moutain%20as%20selftranscendence.jpg)

In June 2025, I visited Kyoto and repeatedly hiked Mount Kurama. During these walks, I engaged in interspecies communication by following openly shared cultural practices rooted in Shinto and Buddhist traditions. The protocol was articulated a posteriori and is not intended as cultural appropriation, but rather as documentation of lived experience and recognition that interspecies communication is embedded in many non-Western knowledge systems. In Shinto cosmology, mountains are kamis.  Kamis are sacred spirits or divine phenomena inhabiting nature… the spirits of the mountains, river, ancestors. This understanding resonates strongly with Andean cosmovisions, where mountains are known as Apus.

This second protocol centers on nurturing spiritual connection with the mountain through rituals of reciprocity as a form of communication. The trail from Mount Kurama to Kuramadera temple is particularly significant, as it weaves together Shinto and Buddhist practices. Before entering the mountain, I participated in a ritual of water purification, washing my hands and mouth with water sourced from the mountain itself. Before crossing torii gates, I bowed and clapped in prescribed sequences to show reverence to the kamis.

Along the trail, I passed through multiple torii gates, some formed by built structures and others by natural elements such as 800-year-old cedar trees. Each crossing marks a threshold between the everyday world and the sacred realm. Upon reaching Kuramadera at the summit, I practiced prayers of gratitude and made offerings, including a poem, before I asked for blessings.

This experience reaffirmed my intuition that rituals are powerful entry points for interspecies communication. Rituals are not just symbolic but very physical acts. Every action of washing the hands with water of the mountain for purification, bowing to the cedar trees before crossing their path, is not just a physical engagement but a cognitive commitment to transcend our state of consciousness. Through reverence toward nature, I experienced moments of self-transcendence, not as erasure of the self, but as integration into a larger whole.

I also learned that communication implies consent, and that consent may sometimes be withheld. Mount Kurama is known as the birthplace of Reiki, and during one visit I felt compelled to walk a particular trail associated with it. I hesitated and asked for consent at a nearby Shinto shrine and sat on the bark of a tree—where I was immediately bitten by an insect, causing intense pain for hours. I interpreted this experience as a clear response: not today. This moment underscored that interspecies communication is not about control or access, but about listening and respecting refusal.

## Protocol 3: mountains as emotional companions

![protocol3](../images/protocol%20moutain%20as%20emotional%20companion.jpg)

On September 30th, 2025, I arrived in Barcelona and felt an immediate pull to visit the closest mountain to my new place of residence: Montjuïc. On my very first day in the city, I hiked up the mountain to introduce myself—to the land and to the city. I watched my first sunset in Barcelona from its slopes and asked the mountain for blessings. This initial encounter inspired the design of a specific protocol to explore Montjuïc as an emotional companion through repeated visits. The protocol consisted of four hikes conducted over the span of two weeks. It was designed a priori and focused on multisensorial attunement and multimedia documentation. 
This protocol relies on multisensorial immersion as a data collection strategy. Each visit followed the same observational structure, allowing for comparison across time while remaining open to emergent experiences. The following elements were documented during each hike:

•Temporal context: time of day and environmental conditions.
•Embodied state: initial and final physical and emotional conditions.
•Tactile and olfactory engagement: touching leaves, soil, rocks; noting textures, temperature, moisture, pace, oscillations, pauses, and stops.
•Soundscape categorized as:
-Biophony: sounds produced by living organisms (e.g., birds, insects),
-Geophony: non-biological natural sounds (e.g., rain, wind),
-Anthrophony: human-made sounds (e.g., traffic, voices).
•Human movement: trail location, directionality, repetition, and morphology of movement.
•Linguistic communication: pre-planned speech directed toward the mountain.
•Responsive communicative acts: improvised oral or written responses triggered by environmental cues, including memories, emotions, and impulses to express through speech, touch, or poetry. These spontaneous acts were recorded as audio or text.

## Analysis and reflection 

The third day of visits was marked by doubt. I questioned whether it was worth hiking that day, feeling depleted and unsure of my capacity to be present, similar to meeting a friend when one is exhausted. By the end of the hike, I initially interpreted the experience as non-communicative. However, that same night I woke up abruptly at 4 a.m. with a clear realization: the mountain is a living agentic presence that participates in my emotional life. They are not just objects that help me to represent my emotions, they help me to regulate and transform them. This experience echoed previous moments of nocturnal clarity, most notably after my first visit to Mount Kurama. Recognizing this pattern reinforced my understanding of interspecies communication as something that extends beyond the moment of encounter.

With this realization that I can relate to mountains as emotional companions, I approached the fourth visit with heightened intentionality. I explicitly asked the mountain to be my emotional support and gave myself permission to be vulnerable. I arrived emotionally overloaded, unable to tell my emotions apart. During the walk this became clear. Although the trail remained the same, its consistent upward morphology created a sense of emotional momentum. Reaching the summit at sunset initially felt peaceful, yet shallow. Watching airplanes cross the sky triggered my feelings of uncertainty due to my recent relocation to Barcelona: although I had physically landed in Barcelona a couple of weeks ago, emotionally I still felt suspended elsewhere, ungrounded. 

As darkness fell, uneasiness intensified and culminated in frustration. I allowed myself to release it. In that moment, the mountain became a space where I felt held and heard. I addressed my human and mountain ancestors, asking for guidance, an act possibly prompted by the nearby cemetery. I began moving repeatedly in a triangular pattern shaped by the terrain: a line of palm trees, the cemetery wall, and the site entrance. My pace accelerated in response to resurfacing emotions: restlessness, displacement, lack of belonging. I asked, explicitly, to feel grounded.

Gradually, my gaze dropped toward the soil as my movement slowed. Drawn to the center of the triangular space, I noticed tiny mushrooms emerging from the ground, which species I couldn’t identify. In that precise moment, I found a gravitational center in that space and moment, and a sense of being held by the soil itself. My breath eased, accompanied by emotional relief and wonder at life underground. Previous experiences with fungi as metaphors for emotional and ontological processing likely informed the intensity of this encounter. I interpreted this moment as a call from the soil, deeply aligned with my desire for grounding during this transitional phase of my life.

Moreover, this protocol highlighted vulnerability as a central condition for interspecies communication. Vulnerability is what renders communication, human and more-than-human, meaningful. Emotional intimacy is not confined to established human relationships; it can emerge with strangers, fleeting encounters, and, as my experience suggests, with mountains.

This experience led me to reconsider the premise of my research. Meaningful communication with mountains may have less to do with advanced technologies or sophisticated algorithms—although those have their place—and more to do with cultivating openness and vulnerability. Mountains, as emotional companions, are peculiar beings: vast in scale, shaped by deep geological time, and offering a perspective in which human lives appear fleeting. It is from this temporal and spatial immensity that I sense a form of wisdom in mountains, one that invites humility, grounding, and care.

## Personal Manifesto

I understand communication not as an empty exchange of information nor as a purely rational processing of data, but as a reciprocal act that cultivates material, affective, emotional, and spiritual entanglements with the more-than-human world.
Communication begins with recognizing the agency of mountains. Mountains are not passive landscapes but living, sensing, and responding presences. I ask for their consent to visit them, and I give my consent to be visited, acknowledging that communication is always a two-way act. 

I communicate with mountains to remember my kinship with nonhuman beings. Mountains are my ancestors. Visiting them activates autobiographical and family memory, allowing me to feel close to those who came before me. Through speaking with both human and mountain ancestors, I practice guardianship as a shared responsibility across generations and species.

I communicate with mountains as an act of deep vulnerability to nurture mutual healing. Mountains are my emotional companions. By offering them my vulnerability, I learn to trust them with my feelings, while also becoming attentive to their own fragility amid anthropogenic disruptions. I receive emotional restoration from mountains, and in return I commit to care for, restore and heal their damaged or threatened landscapes.

I communicate to experience spiritual self-transcendence. Mountains are sites of pilgrimage and transformation. Through rituals of reciprocity, they afford transitions into altered states of consciousness, to experience the boundless flow of nature.  The sacred emerges through embodied practice, reverence, and sustained relationship.
