# Prothesis One: Echoing Branches {: .master-title}

I can “listen to the mountain” by becoming an extended body of branches that transform my movement across the morphology mountain into sound.

How do I listen to the mountain? Can movement be a language to communicate with the mountain? The sound of movement is a dialogue that only emerges from my conscious interaction with the morphology of the mountain. Can I augment my senses to hear that movement?  Echoing Branches is a wearable sensor-body made with tree branches that expand the spatial awareness of our bodies and mechanically interact with the mountain surfaces through our movement.  The branches pick up mechanical vibration and surface contact; microphone contacts at their tips convert these mechanical signals into electrical signals; those signals are sonified (or frequency-shifted) and delivered to your skull via bone-conduction transducers, letting you perceive the mountain's textures and micro-movements as sound, without blocking ambient hearing.
