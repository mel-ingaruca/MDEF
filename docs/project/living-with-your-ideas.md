# Prothesis One: Echoing Branches {: .master-title}


![frase](quote1/.jpg)


Echoing Branch es is a sculptural extension of the body — a structure of tree branches that expands my spatial awareness through sound. Each branch acts as an external sensory limb, equipped with contact microphones at its tips. As I move, the branches brush against the environment, picking up subtle vibrations and surface contacts. These mechanical signals are converted into electrical ones, then sonified and transmitted to my skull via bone-conduction transducers. Through this, I perceive the textures and micro-movements of the surrounding space as sound — experiencing the world’s surfaces and resonances without obstructing my natural hearing.

For some time now, I have been drawn to a curious endeavor: talking to the mountains. But how does one even begin to listen to a mountain? Sometimes nature speaks to us loudly — birds chirping, frogs croaking, bees humming. But listening to abiotic nature is a challenge. A mountain exists in deep time: static to our perception, immense beyond our grasp.

Then it occurred to me — could movement be a language to communicate with the mountain? After all, movement only emerges through my conscious interaction with the mountain’s morphology. It is a dialogue. The mountain affords my movement. Yet my body feels so small compared to its vastness. I felt the urge to expand — even if a bit — the reach of my body.

The notion of cyborg offered some inspiration to approach this experimentation. Cyborg art is about creating new senses or expanding the existing ones to better connect to ecologies. My challenge was to develop a sensory prothesis to untap a new channel of communication with the mountain. However, I still have a problem with the aesthetics of sensory augmentation because the materiality is mostly made of electronics, wires and cables. My approach was to expand my sensory system with natural elements. This is how I arrived at the idea of Echoing branches. I set up to collect fallen tree branches in Poblenou. I attached them with a wire so that I could wear them in the arms, legs (below the knees) and shoulders facing my back. In this way, I extended the reach of my body with the branches. When walking I could feel the vibrations of my movement. So subtle. But could I go further? Could I translate that felt sense into sound? Attaching contact microphones to the branches’ tips could allow me to capture the sounds and amplify them in my walking experience, bringing the sounds to the abiotic to the forefront of my acoustic experience. Can the sound of the movement tell me something about the mountain? What conversations will emerge?
