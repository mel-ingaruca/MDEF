In the echoes of my movement, I hear the mountain\u201d Echoing Branch es is a sculptural extension of the body \u2014 a structure of tree branches that expands my spatial awareness through sound. Each branch acts as an external sensory limb, equipped with contact microphones at its tips. As I move, the branches brush against the environment, picking up subtle vibrations and surface contacts. These mechanical signals are converted into electrical ones, then sonified and transmitted to my skull via bone-conduction transducers. Through this, I perceive the textures and micro-movements of the surrounding space as sound \u2014 experiencing the world\u2019s surfaces and resonances without obstructing my natural hearing. Reflection \u00b6 For some time now, I have been drawn to a curious endeavor: talking to the mountains. But how does one even begin to listen to a mountain? Sometimes nature speaks to us loudly \u2014 birds chirping, frogs croaking, bees humming. But listening to abiotic nature is a challenge. A mountain exists in deep time: static to our perception, immense beyond our grasp. Then it occurred to me \u2014 could movement be a language to communicate with the mountain? After all, movement only emerges through my conscious interaction with the mountain\u2019s morphology. It is a dialogue. The mountain affords my movement. Yet my body feels so small compared to its vastness. I felt the urge to expand \u2014 even if a bit \u2014 the reach of my body. The notion of cyborg offered some inspiration for this experiment. Cyborg art is about creating new senses or expanding the existing ones to better connect to ecologies. My challenge was to develop a sensory prothesis to untap a new channel of communication with the mountain. However, I\u2019ve long felt uneasy about the conventional aesthetics of sensory augmentation that are loaded with electronics, wires, and synthetic materials \u2014 a technological skin that, to me, feels at odds with the organic world I seek to attune to. I wanted to expand my sensory system with natural elements. So I set up to collect fallen tree branches in Poblenou. This was the starting point for Echoing Branches. I attached the branches with a wire so that any person could wear them in the arms, legs (below the knees) and back. I ran some tests in the space of IAAC building (Thanks Ayal for wearing the branches!). And outside in the streets of Poblenou! I extended the reach of my body with the branches. As I walked, I could feel subtle vibrations through the branches \u2014 traces of movement, friction, and contact. Now I am ready for the mountain. But could I go further? Could this tactile sense also become audible? By attaching contact microphones to the branches\u2019 tips, I could translate those vibrations into sound, amplifying the otherwise inaudible interactions between my movement and the mountain. Walking would be transformed by the act of bringing the sounds of the biotic to the forefront of my acoustic experience. Can the sound of the movement tell me something about the mountain? What conversations will emerge? Through the branches of a fallen tree, I expand my hearing. In the echoes of my movement, I hear the mountain Prothesis brief: Becoming the best version of yourself. Inspiration: Becoming a cyborg by Manuel de Aguas, song \u201cVoy Creciendo\u201d by Natalia Doco. Materials: fallen tree branches picked up from Poblenou.
