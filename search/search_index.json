They are the background of human activities. Meanwhile in other non-western indigenous traditions mountains are subjects. In Andean worldviews, mountains are apus, spirits, monta\u00f1as sagradas. They are animate, have personality, will and consciousness. People speak to the mountain, a symbolic act that addresses the mountain as a subject with agency. In rituals of Pago a la Tierra, people give offerings to the land: corn, coca leaves, tabaco, animals, to show gratitude or ask for blessings. That is how they enact reciprocity with the land. Amid a growing interest in interspecies communication in the western world through technical and scientific methods, I wanted to explore interspecies communication with the mountains through intuition-led, affective and embodied modes of inquiry Method: first-person research to communicate with the mountains \u00b6 I adopted a first-person perspective to explore how interspecies communication with mountains might be practiced and understood. This methodological orientation emerged through reflection on my visits in 2025 to mountains in Peru and Japan that resonated deeply with me on emotional and spiritual levels. I became aware that I was already engaging in a form of interspecies communication during these visits, even though it was not explicitly framed as such at the time. From these encounters, I developed two design protocols through post-reflection, which allowed me to articulate early insights into interspecies communication. Building upon them, I later created a third protocol to explore communication with Montju\u00efc, a mountain in Barcelona. Together, these protocols function as both documentation and methodological tools for exploring how humans can engage in interspecies communication with mountains. Protocol 1: mountains as kin \u00b6 In early 2025, I visited the Peruvian mountains connected to my grandparents\u2019 lineages in Satipo (Jun\u00edn) and Huamanga (Ayacucho). These walks were conceived as acts of making kin with the mountains, and of reconnecting with landscapes that are inseparable from my family history. This protocol functions as a ritual of communication intended to remember and re-activate the relationship between my human lineage and the mountains. It begun by visiting landscapes intertwined with family stories, sometimes accompanied by relatives and sometimes alone. A key practice is the conscious recollection of names\u2014of family members and of the mountains themselves\u2014as a way of situating oneself within a lineage that includes both human and more-than-human actors. Upon entering the mountain, introducing oneself is an essential gesture of respect. I then asked the mountain for guidance in unveiling family history. As the walk unfolds, I situated myself within known family narratives and anecdotes while remaining attentive to the unknowns. As we enter deeper into the mountain, we trust we will get answers: emotionally charged encounters with biotic and abiotic elements are treated as messages. Some interactions trigger memories and stories shared by my grandparents; others provoke speculation and imaginative reconstruction. I understand this process as an archaeology of family memory. After sharing intimate and emotional moments with my family, we embraced mountains as kin. The feeling lingers even now. A practice to nurture this connection is talking to my human and mountain ancestors to ask for guardianship. I chose this context as an example of interspecies communication because it is my heritage. The practice of speaking to mountains has been present in my family across generations. On my mother\u2019s side, my grandmother Edith Cebri\u00e1n used to sing to the mountains. At the age of fourteen, she left her life behind in the mountains of Huamanga (Ayacucho) to migrate to Lima, saying goodbye to the land and promising never to return\u2014a promise she kept. In January 2025, some of her descendants, including myself, returned to these mountains for the first time. My grandfather V\u00edctor Moreno maintained a deeply contemplative relationship with the land, often walking and meditating in the tropical mountains of Satipo. It was during one of these walks, on his 56 th birthday, that he died in an accident when a loose tree fell on him. These narratives shape my understanding of mountains not as passive landscapes but as active participants in family history. Migration to the city has distanced my living family in Lima from the land, resulting in the loss of important practices of interspecies communication, such as Pago a la Tierra\u2014an Andean ritual of reciprocity with the land. These visits revealed not only collective histories but also personal insights. The mountains offered responses that I later translated into creative expression, including two poems written during these encounters. Poem for my grandmother Edith. Huamanga Mountains, Ayacucho. January 2025 De lila a azul, un atardecer que me traspasa la piel. De 1934 al 2025, la sangre que nos recorre y que ha encontrado su camino de vuelta. Te fuiste a los 10 a\u00f1os de Ayacucho, y a los 75 a\u00f1os de este mundo, y nunca volviste a este atardecer, y yo, tan lejos me he ido antes de traerte de vuelta, algo de ti, la parte que vive en m\u00ed. Y aqu\u00ed estoy en Ayacucho, mami, A veces Eduarda, A veces Rosa, A veces Edith Cebri\u00e1n Rojas. Con el \u00faltimo nombre te conoc\u00ed yo. Presumo, a veces, ser la nieta que m\u00e1s tiempo pas\u00f3 contigo, pero que tan poco se de tu historia en Ayacucho. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 te fuiste de ni\u00f1a? Desenterramos recuerdos, una arqueologia emocional. Lo que queda al descubierto se siente como un nervio expuesto. Una injusticia sin rostro: el racismo-clasismo que mat\u00f3 a tu madre. All\u00e1 a inicios del siglo XX, Pedro Cebri\u00e1n Matamoros, un mestizo con privilegios, se cas\u00f3 con Cirila Rojas. Una mujer muy hermosa, pero muy humilde seg\u00fan la recuerda la memoria familiar. El matrimonio fue mal visto, pero la sentencia llegar\u00eda el d\u00eda del parto de tu hermano. La partera fue amenazada: si atend\u00eda a tu madre, nadie le dar\u00eda m\u00e1s trabajo. No hay poes\u00eda que pueda maquillar la tragedia: Tu madre muri\u00f3 en el parto, y un remolino de dolor se llev\u00f3 a tu padre tambi\u00e9n. Don Pedro se escondi\u00f3 en el alcohol. Semanas despu\u00e9s, en un descuido, muri\u00f3 tu hermano de c\u00f3licos. En el cielo arde tu dolor. \u00bfCual atardecer te vio escapar? Prometiste no volver, pero nosotros hemos vuelto. Volvimos para sentir profundo. Para encontrar la l\u00e1pida de tu padre con su nombre completito; y a tu madre enterrada debajo de la capilla del cementerio, \u201cal fondo nomas\u201d, sin lapida y sin nombre, con su historia an\u00f3nima tambi\u00e9n en la memoria familar \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 mami? Nunca encontramos una foto suya. Mi mam\u00e1 me ha contando, por primera vez, que tu la llamabas Lila. Sonr\u00edo. Es mi color favorito y siempre me rodea. Hoy la Lila del atardecer me abraza en esta monta\u00f1a, con el calorcito del sol que ya se fue, que suavemente se despide. A\u00fan est\u00e1s conmigo, mami, suavemente abraz\u00e1ndome tambi\u00e9n. En Lila, siempre. Poem for my grandfather Victor Moreno Satipo Mountains. February, 2025 Victor Moreno naci\u00f3 en La Libertad pero emigr\u00f3 2 veces, la segunda a Satipo. Siempre sent\u00ed la relaci\u00f3n con mi abuelo como intrascendente. El vivia lejos y manten\u00eda una distancia emocional conmigo a la que me acostumbr\u00e9. Pero fue \u00e9l quien me regal\u00f3 mis primeras memorias de la selva. Recuerdo mi primer viaje a Satipo en un bus interprovincial. De un lado, las estrellas a trav\u00e9s de la ventana, y del otro, a mi mam\u00e1 desmoron\u00e1ndose del soroche. Recuerdo el olor a la timolina, y su promesa de que ya vamos a llegar, hijita. Recuerdo despertar y ver esas monta\u00f1as tan verdes por primera vez. Siempre las veo un poco en la memoria. Recuerdo mi incredulidad cuando me dijeron que cruzar\u00eda el r\u00edo en un huaro, una tablita que colgaba de 4 cables de dudosa calidad. Recuerdo el llano m\u00e1s arriba de las monta\u00f1as donde viv\u00eda mi abuelo. Recuerdo secar cacao al sol. Y en las noches, la sopa con yuca frita. La oscuridad profunda. El cielo infinitamente habitado de estrellas. La v\u00eda l\u00e1ctea por primera vez. Lo recuerdo a \u00e9l contando historias a la luz de la vela, historias de esp\u00edritus del monte, de reencarnaci\u00f3n y otros eventos paranormales. Suspendida en sus historias, olvidaba la distancia que el territorio y, quiz\u00e1 mi abuelo mismo, hab\u00edan puesto entre nosotros . Si mi abuelo alguna vez me dio alg\u00fan consejo no lo recuerdo, pero \u00e9l me dio la selva y las noches estrelladas. \u00c9l muri\u00f3 el d\u00eda de su cumplea\u00f1os. Caminaba por su chacra cuando un \u00e1rbol le cay\u00f3 encima. Tan casualmente. Por mucho tiempo cuestionamos esa historia con mi mam\u00e1 \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede caer un \u00e1rbol tan de repente? En febrero del 2025 volv\u00ed a Satipo. Frente a la tumba de mi abuelo, le contaba a un amigo la historia del \u00e1rbol, sin creerla a\u00fan. Al d\u00eda siguiente, me encontraba en una comunidad Ashaninka, cuando un \u00e1rbol cay\u00f3 en el umbral de una puerta que solo segundos antes hab\u00edan cruzado 2 personas. Y as\u00ed, quiz\u00e1 por primera vez pens\u00e9 en mi abuelo de forma trascendente. Sent\u00ed, quiza ingenuamente, pero certeramente, que era \u00e9l, dici\u00e9ndome, hijita ve y cu\u00e9ntale a tu madre que fue un \u00e1rbol, que fue la selva y solo ella que me llam\u00f3 para llevarme adentro. Aqu\u00ed estoy abuelo, pens\u00e9, creo que Satipo me est\u00e1 llamando tambi\u00e9n. Protocol 2: Self-Transcendence in the Mountains \u00b6 In June 2025, I visited Kyoto and repeatedly hiked Mount Kurama. During these walks, I engaged in interspecies communication by following openly shared cultural practices rooted in Shinto and Buddhist traditions. The protocol was articulated a posteriori and is not intended as cultural appropriation, but rather as documentation of lived experience and recognition that interspecies communication is embedded in many non-Western knowledge systems. In Shinto cosmology, mountains are kamis. Kamis are sacred spirits or divine phenomena inhabiting nature\u2026 the spirits of the mountains, river, ancestors. This understanding resonates strongly with Andean cosmovisions, where mountains are known as Apus. This second protocol centers on nurturing spiritual connection with the mountain through rituals of reciprocity as a form of communication. The trail from Mount Kurama to Kuramadera temple is particularly significant, as it weaves together Shinto and Buddhist practices. Before entering the mountain, I participated in a ritual of water purification, washing my hands and mouth with water sourced from the mountain itself. Before crossing torii gates, I bowed and clapped in prescribed sequences to show reverence to the kamis. Along the trail, I passed through multiple torii gates, some formed by built structures and others by natural elements such as 800-year-old cedar trees. Each crossing marks a threshold between the everyday world and the sacred realm. Upon reaching Kuramadera at the summit, I practiced prayers of gratitude and made offerings, including a poem, before I asked for blessings. This experience reaffirmed my intuition that rituals are powerful entry points for interspecies communication. Rituals are not just symbolic but very physical acts. Every action of washing the hands with water of the mountain for purification, bowing to the cedar trees before crossing their path, is not just a physical engagement but a cognitive commitment to transcend our state of consciousness. Through reverence toward nature, I experienced moments of self-transcendence, not as erasure of the self, but as integration into a larger whole. I also learned that communication implies consent, and that consent may sometimes be withheld. Mount Kurama is known as the birthplace of Reiki, and during one visit I felt compelled to walk a particular trail associated with it. I hesitated and asked for consent at a nearby Shinto shrine and sat on the bark of a tree\u2014where I was immediately bitten by an insect, causing intense pain for hours. I interpreted this experience as a clear response: not today. This moment underscored that interspecies communication is not about control or access, but about listening and respecting refusal. Protocol 3: mountains as emotional companions \u00b6 On September 30 th , 2025, I arrived in Barcelona and felt an immediate pull to visit the closest mountain to my new place of residence: Montju\u00efc. On my very first day in the city, I hiked up the mountain to introduce myself\u2014to the land and to the city. I watched my first sunset in Barcelona from its slopes and asked the mountain for blessings. This initial encounter inspired the design of a specific protocol to explore Montju\u00efc as an emotional companion through repeated visits. The protocol consisted of four hikes conducted over the span of two weeks. It was designed a priori and focused on multisensorial attunement and multimedia documentation. This protocol relies on multisensorial immersion as a data collection strategy. Each visit followed the same observational structure, allowing for comparison across time while remaining open to emergent experiences. The following elements were documented during each hike: -Temporal context: time of day and environmental conditions. -Embodied state: initial and final physical and emotional conditions. -Tactile and olfactory engagement: touching leaves, soil, rocks; noting textures, temperature, moisture, pace, oscillations, pauses, and stops. -Soundscape categorized as: Biophony: sounds produced by living organisms (e.g., birds, insects), Geophony: non-biological natural sounds (e.g., rain, wind), Anthrophony: human-made sounds (e.g., traffic, voices). -Human movement: trail location, directionality, repetition, and morphology of movement. -Linguistic communication: pre-planned speech directed toward the mountain. -Responsive communicative acts: improvised oral or written responses triggered by environmental cues, including memories, emotions, and impulses to express through speech, touch, or poetry. These spontaneous acts were recorded as audio or text. - **Example: Montju\u00efc visit, day 3** - **Initial physical state:** physically exhausted after hiking to Valldaura Labs; still recovering from the flu. - **Initial affective state:** tired, longing for company without conversation; seeking reflection and quiet presence. - **Tactile engagement:** intermittent rain felt on the body; contact with wet leaves, soil, and rocks. - **Olfactory engagement:** smell of rain and wet earth. - **Voice:** poems were recited aloud at the summit and reflections recorded orally; otherwise, silence was maintained. - **Soundscape:** - **Biophony:** birds and insects - **Geophony:** intermittent rain, heavier at the beginning of the hike - **Anthrophony:** traffic noise near the base, fading into quiet at the top, with distant white noise from the city - **Movement:** continuous upward movement along a fixed path\u2014stairs, concrete pathway, soil trail\u2014ending at the highest point aligned with a row of palm trees. - **Speech:** poems recounting my encounters with other mountains I had visited that year - **Final state:** physically tired but emotionally restored Analysis and reflection \u00b6 The third day of visits was marked by doubt. I questioned whether it was worth hiking that day, feeling depleted and unsure of my capacity to be present, similar to meeting a friend when one is exhausted. By the end of the hike, I initially interpreted the experience as non-communicative. However, that same night I woke up abruptly at 4 a.m. with a clear realization: the mountain is a living agentic presence that participates in my emotional life. They are not just objects that help me to represent my emotions, they help me to regulate and transform them. This experience echoed previous moments of nocturnal clarity, most notably after my first visit to Mount Kurama. Recognizing this pattern reinforced my understanding of interspecies communication as something that extends beyond the moment of encounter. With this realization that I can relate to mountains as emotional companions, I approached the fourth visit with heightened intentionality. I explicitly asked the mountain to be my emotional support and gave myself permission to be vulnerable. I arrived emotionally overloaded, unable to tell my emotions apart. During the walk this became clear. Although the trail remained the same, its consistent upward morphology created a sense of emotional momentum. Reaching the summit at sunset initially felt peaceful, yet shallow. Watching airplanes cross the sky triggered my feelings of uncertainty due to my recent relocation to Barcelona: although I had physically landed in Barcelona a couple of weeks ago, emotionally I still felt suspended elsewhere, ungrounded. As darkness fell, uneasiness intensified and culminated in frustration. I allowed myself to release it. In that moment, the mountain became a space where I felt held and heard. I addressed my human and mountain ancestors, asking for guidance, an act possibly prompted by the nearby cemetery. I began moving repeatedly in a triangular pattern shaped by the terrain: a line of palm trees, the cemetery wall, and the site entrance. My pace accelerated in response to resurfacing emotions: restlessness, displacement, lack of belonging. I asked, explicitly, to feel grounded. Gradually, my gaze dropped toward the soil as my movement slowed. Drawn to the center of the triangular space, I noticed tiny mushrooms emerging from the ground, which species I couldn\u2019t identify. In that precise moment, I found a gravitational center in that space and moment, and a sense of being held by the soil itself. My breath eased, accompanied by emotional relief and wonder at life underground. Previous experiences with fungi as metaphors for emotional and ontological processing likely informed the intensity of this encounter. I interpreted this moment as a call from the soil, deeply aligned with my desire for grounding during this transitional phase of my life. Moreover, this protocol highlighted vulnerability as a central condition for interspecies communication. Vulnerability is what renders communication, human and more-than-human, meaningful. Emotional intimacy is not confined to established human relationships; it can emerge with strangers, fleeting encounters, and, as my experience suggests, with mountains. This experience led me to reconsider the premise of my research. Meaningful communication with mountains may have less to do with advanced technologies or sophisticated algorithms\u2014although those have their place\u2014and more to do with cultivating openness and vulnerability. Mountains, as emotional companions, are peculiar beings: vast in scale, shaped by deep geological time, and offering a perspective in which human lives appear fleeting. It is from this temporal and spatial immensity that I sense a form of wisdom in mountains, one that invites humility, grounding, and care. Personal Manifesto \u00b6 I understand communication not as an empty exchange of information nor as a purely rational processing of data, but as a reciprocal act that cultivates material, affective, emotional, and spiritual entanglements with the more-than-human world. Communication begins with recognizing the agency of mountains. Mountains are not passive landscapes but living, sensing, and responding presences. I ask for their consent to visit them, and I give my consent to be visited, acknowledging that communication is always a two-way act. I communicate with mountains to remember my kinship with nonhuman beings. Mountains are my ancestors. Visiting them activates autobiographical and family memory, allowing me to feel close to those who came before me. Through speaking with both human and mountain ancestors, I practice guardianship as a shared responsibility across generations and species. I communicate with mountains as an act of deep vulnerability to nurture mutual healing. Mountains are my emotional companions. By offering them my vulnerability, I learn to trust them with my feelings, while also becoming attentive to their own fragility amid anthropogenic disruptions. I receive emotional restoration from mountains, and in return I commit to care for, restore and heal their damaged or threatened landscapes. I communicate to experience spiritual self-transcendence. Mountains are sites of pilgrimage and transformation. Through rituals of reciprocity, they afford transitions into altered states of consciousness, to experience the boundless flow of nature. The sacred emerges through embodied practice, reverence, and sustained relationship. II Prototyping Actions: interspecies communication with the mountain \u00b6 __ Conceptual Definition: I want to design an interspecies communication system to engage and practice mutual healing with the mountain interspecies communities, as a radical act of reciprocity. __ Hypothesis 1 : I can embody the stillness of the mountain as a form of human communication. This can help me to train myself to embrace stillness as a form of communication to cultivate attentiveness to nature. Prototype idea 1 : I can create ritualistic practice that involves stillness as a form of communication. The set up will consist of 2 people sitting in meditative positions facing each other. The experiment consists in looking at each other\u2019s eyes for 20 minutes while holding a still facial expression and body posture This exercise also helps me to decenter myself from human communication standards because my human relationships are full with words, and sometimes I judge human communication based on the capacity of people to orchestrate words in a beautiful way. And it doesn\u2019t have to be. I thought of the mountain as a teacher in how I communicate. I want to test what would it be like to communicate with somebody that I already know not with words but with static presence (being present while remaining still or unmoving). Hypothesis 2 : I can \u201clisten to the mountain\u201d by becoming an extended body of branches with contact microphones while I conduct meditative walks in Collserola Mountain. Prototype idea 2 : EchoingBranches is a wearable sensor-body made from branch-like arms that mechanically interact with the mountain surfaces. The branches pick up low-frequency/mechanical vibration and surface contact; sensors at their tips convert these mechanical signals into electrical signals; those signals are sonified (or frequency-shifted) and delivered to your skull via bone-conduction transducers, letting you perceive the mountain\u2019s textures and micro-movements as sound/vibration. Hypothesis 3 : I can create an ecoacoustic system to contribute to increase biodiversity in Collserola mountain. Ecoacoustic restoration is the interdisciplinary field that studies and applies sound-based methods to restore damaged ecosystems. Prototype idea 3 : EchoingSoil is an experience that allows me to communicate with the soil for mutual healing. Sounds of the soil can offer me restorative effects, and, in turn, I can broadcast restorative sounds to the soil microbiota III Acting Individually: Towards Mutual Healing \u00b6 Conceptual Statement \u00b6 In a modern world that has forgotten to listen to the voice of Mother Nature, I want to create an embodied interspecies communication system to listen and speak to the soil. Inspired by notions of reciprocity, biophilia and ecoacoustic restoration, I frame the exchange of sounds and vibrations between humans and soil as a practice of mutual care and healing. Action Strategy: ritualistic + scientific-technical \u00b6 I wanted to explore integrating different entry points into interspecies communications. On one hand, I wanted to approach communication with the soil as a deeply affective and intuitive-oriented practice, and on the other hand, I wanted to explore scientific frameworks of communication as a form of sonic restoration of biodiversity, and the use of electronics to communicate with the soil. Site: Collserola Mountains Collserola is a Mediterranean forest ecosystem, featuring distinct habitats such as holm oak and pine forests, gallery forests, scrubland, and aquatic environments. The area is characterized by plants like holm oak, Aleppo pine, and various oaks, supported by a diverse range of fauna, including wild boars, genets, and a variety of birds. As students, we have access to Valldaura Labs, situated at the top of one of the mountains. There were a few contexts around Valldaura Labs that were initially of interest to me: A: Broadcast combined sounds of natural predators of squirrels and squirrels\u2019 alarm calls as acoustic repellents to protect nurseries for oak trees B: Broadcast sounds of birds, insects, and small mammals for wildlife recolonization in patches of connectivity interest C: Broadcast sounds for soil microbiota (fungi, bacteria) in our collective land plot to grow medicinal plants I ended up choosing option C because of my ongoing relationship with the land plot and my interest in exploring my entanglements with soil. Artifact 1: EchoingBranches \u00b6 Augmented branches is a sculptural extension of my body \u2014 a structure of tree branches that allows me to listen to the vibration of my movement through the soil and record it. Each branch is equipped with contact microphones at its tips. As I move, the branches brush against the environment, picking up subtle vibrations and surface contacts. These mechanical signals are converted into electrical ones, then the sound is transmitted to my skull via bone-conduction transducers and recorded. Through this prothesis, I can explore the restorative effects of the sound or vibrations of the soil morphology as I climb Collserola. Technical strategy: system of contact microphones \u00b6 The initial idea was to also collect those sounds to broadcast it to the soil microbiota in the collective garden. However, due to technical problems with the contact microphone that I bought, I didn\u2019t fully develop this artifact. I wore the branches and engaged only with the vibration of my movement in the soil morphology as I hiked up to the land plot. Artifact 2: EchoingSoil \u00b6 EchoingSoil is an electronic system that broadcasts sounds to the soil microbiota to enhance soil biodiversity and improve nutrient cycling and plant growth. Iterative sounds of 8Khz can stimulate beneficial fungus (e.g. Trichoderma harzianum) that promotes plant growth, nutrient cycling, and pathogen resistance Scientific strategy: Sonic restoration of soil \u00b6 One source of inspiration for this action is the field of ecoacoustic restoration that sustains that by orchestrating soundscapes, we can increase the likelihood of organisms recolonizing degraded habitats. Specifically, I want to explore sonic restoration of soil. It has been recently studied that soil microorganisms not only emit sound but are also able to listen to it through a mechanisms of mechanoperception, with behavioral impacts. Earthworms, isopods, roots, bacteria, and fungi all respond to mechanical vibrations. For example, I followed a scientific protocol that tested sound at specific frequencies of 8 to 11 Khz to stimulate Trichoderma harzianum, a beneficial fungus that promotes plant growth, nutrient cycling, and pathogen resistance. The treatment with sound increase biomass growth in the fungi. Scientific parameters for sound traits Parameter Based on Robinson et al. (2024) and related literature Frequency range Band-limited noise including frequencies from roughly 4,000 Hz up to 11,000 Hz, centered on 8,000 Hz (4\u201311 kHz bandwidth, 8 kHz peak). Lower frequencies (<1 kHz) travel better in soil but may affect organisms differently; some low frequencies inhibit fungal growth. Sound level Around 80 dB SPL measured near the source. Keep below ~90 dB to avoid adverse effects or soil heating. Duration 30 minutes per day for 5 days yielded clear effects. Continuous 24/7 playback has not been tested and may not be necessary; intermittent exposure appears more realistic and energy-efficient. Signal type Continuous monotone or band-limited noise (not music). In laboratory settings, a pure 8 kHz tone file (\u201ctinnitus masker\u201d audio) was used. Medium coupling The speaker must be in direct contact with soil (e.g., embedded waterproof transducers). Sound attenuates rapidly with depth, especially above 1 kHz. Target organisms Beneficial fungi (especially Trichoderma ) and possibly bacteria. Technical strategy: Arduino system to broadcast sounds to the soil \u00b6 I built an electronic consisting of a Barduino connected to a DFplayer and a small speaker. Then I programmed in Arduino IDE a step that controls the broadcasting of the sound of 8kHz. The audio will play 30 minutes one time a day, and repeat this for 5 days. Electronic system: Wiring diagram Electronic system: Coding for Arduino IDE Arduino sketch \u2014 DFPlayer soil sound playback #include <SoftwareSerial.h> #include <DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h> SoftwareSerial mySerial ( 10 , 11 ); // RX, TX DFRobotDFPlayerMini myDFPlayer ; // Set up the time variables const int playDuration = 30 * 60 * 1000 ; // 30 minutes in milliseconds const int totalDays = 5 ; void setup () { mySerial . begin ( 9600 ); Serial . begin ( 9600 ); if ( ! myDFPlayer . begin ( mySerial )) { Serial . println ( \"DFPlayer not found!\" ); while ( true ); } myDFPlayer . volume ( 20 ); // Volume range 0~30 Serial . println ( \"DFPlayer ready!\" ); } void loop () { for ( int day = 1 ; day <= totalDays ; day ++ ) { Serial . print ( \"Playing day \" ); Serial . println ( day ); myDFPlayer . play ( 1 ); // Plays track 001.mp3 on TF card unsigned long startTime = millis (); while ( millis () - startTime < playDuration ) { // Wait 30 minutes } myDFPlayer . stop (); // Stop after 30 min delay ( 24L * 60 * 60 * 1000 ); // Wait 24 hours until next day } while ( true ); // Stop after 5 days } Design Protocol \u00b6 Learn technical language (scientific + electronic) to communicate with soil>> Assemble electronic system and code >> Hike up the mountain wearing EchoingBranches >> Meditative walk >> Listen to the sounds of my movement in the soil >> Enjoy restorative effects >> Collect sounds ( ) >> Arrive to the collective plot at the summit of the hike >>Ask for consent to speak to the soil >> Bury electronic system in land plot >> Play audio file of 8Khz for 30 minutes >> Repeat for 5 days ( )Technical difficulties: I couldn\u2019t match the contact mic with a recording device or speaker due to the lack of embedded amplifier in the microphone or external amp. Reflection \u00b6 After this experiment, I reflected deeply on the acoustic agency of soil and how it impacts me and can impact humans. The act of walking up the mountain and hearing the pulse of movement is a \u201csurface\u201d listening. I wonder: can I create another device to listen underground the sounds of bacteria and mycelium? And can listening to the soil remotely be restorative for human emotional/physical health? Healing with soil acoustics? how can I amplify the restorative effects of soil sound in humans? Is there any translation to specific frequencies that achieves this purpose? Moreover, can I add other sensors in the soil to expand our hearing capacity? Many soil organisms produce vibrations outside the human hearing range. And beyond expanding our listening capacity, I reflected on how we can become more responsive to the acoustic agency of the soil. While listening to the vibrations of the soil brings to the forefront of our acoustic experience, a world that we have largely silenced and ignored, that is just a first step to nurture soil reciprocities. I wonder how we can be transformed by soil sounds. Can continuous listening train us to recognize and understand soil health as is the case in soil acoustic for biodiversity monitoring? IV Act Collectively: Mutual healing with soil communities \u00b6 Community: soil biodiversity \u00b6 I reflected on the scope and identity of the community that I want to engage with my action. It is the soil, but the soil can be understood from different worldviews. In western anthropocentric thought, soil is seen as inert, passive and inanimate object, therefore it is easy to exploit it, to expel it from the city, to pave over it and silence it. This is the dominant narrative and perhaps the root cause of our current global soil crisis. But soil is not inert. It is agentic and alive, and I wanted to focus on getting to know that soil community and adjust my action design to better communicate with that diversity. My collective action objective remained the same: mutual healing. This entails both: emotional restoration for the human subject (me) and ecological restoration for the soil of our land plot in Valldaura Labs. Understanding the ways in which the soil and me are vulnerable was important as a baseline. My disconnection to land has to do with my migration history, that started even before me, with my past generations losing their connection to land to migrate to the capital city in Peru. As a migrant living for 8 years in 3 different European cities in temporal housing, I have lacked opportunities to develop a sense of stewardship for land. That sense of ungroundedness has become stronger in the past year. In a larger scale, I reflected on the current state of soil degradation in the Anthropocene. But specifically, I reviewed a report of \u201cSoil Vulnerability in Catalunya\u201d. There I found that the larger problems of soil degradation in the Catalunya region are agricultural erosion (water/wind) and nitrate pollution. However, in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area the main drivers of soil vulnerability are soil sealing from urbanization and infrastructure, and pollution from extractive activities and landfills. Vulnerability Map: Soil degradation in Catalunya When a connection is broken, everyone suffers from it. And there is no mutual healing without nurturing a healthy human-soil entanglement. Sometimes to start this process we need to find places of biocultural hope. I read that the most biodiverse soil is perhaps situated in more undisturbed sites of the metropolitan area like Collserola Park. Coincidentaly, it was the place that had provided me with the opportunity to care for soil in the past 3 months. As students we were provided a plot of land that we prepared by removing weeds, adding compost, sawing medicinal plants like lemongrass, ruda, calendula, among others and watering. So I continue my experimentation there. For my collective action in Valldaura Labs my aim was to broadcast sounds in the soil that provides a direct stimulation of beneficial fungi and bacterial communities. This would not only potentially increase soil biodiversity but also enhance the conditions for the growth of the medicinal plants of the land plot, further contributing to human healing. I treated the sound frequencies to target insects, nematodes, to beneficial fungi and bacteria. Especially, the Trichoderma fungi that is extremely common and often abundant in compost and healthy garden soils. EchoingSoil 2.0: Collective Action Strategy \u00b6 In a second iteration of my action, I challenged myself to keep expanding and integrating the ritualistic, affective, scientific, technological dimensions of interspecies communication with the soil in the development of EchoingSoil. EchoingSoil 2.0 is a system that broadcast low-frequency sounds from x to x to the soil multispecies community, from earthworms to beneficial fungi to increase soil biodiversity and enhance the conditions for medicinal plants to thrive. Iterative sound treatment can stimulate biomass growth of beneficial fungus Trichoderma harzianum that promotes plant growth, nutrient cycling, and pathogen resistance Scientific evidence for sonic restoration in soil: \u00b6 Understanding how soil organisms communicate with sound from a scientific angle was my first step. Communication in the soil occurs at low frequencies for organisms such as earthworms, insect larvae and plant roots. While sounds soil mycelium and bacteria emit is less studied, some research suggests they emit and react to low frequencies. Some scientists suggest a fungal response to sound could be increased sporulation. Soil Community Sound Frequency / Notes Earthworms & macrofauna 20 Hz \u2013 1.5 kHz (peaking 100\u2013500 Hz) Insect larvae (chewing, movement) 100 Hz \u2013 3 kHz Plant roots growth Up to 2 kHz Bacterial biofilm (Murphy et al., 2016) Acoustic vibration (50 Hz) enhanced Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation This makes sense because in general soil is a dense, solid, and porous medium that strongly absorbs high-frequency sounds and efficiently transmits low-frequency ones (typically below 2-5 kHz). A study on effective propagation range shows that frequencies below 1 kHz (1000 Hz) travel farthest in soil. In the previous iteration of this experiment, I broadcasted a high-frequency sound of 8Khz to the soil. Perhaps for limited scientific knowledge of soil in the beginning I didn\u2019t realize that sound was only meant for lab settings not for a soil set up. The 8kHz frequency was transmitted to petri dishes of Trichoderma through air not below ground. So, this time the frequency parameter was from 0 to 1500 Hz I also plan to prepare petri dishes with Trichoderma (good for soil fertility) and Pleurotus Ostreatus (good for bioremediation) to test the sound treatment impact on biomass growth. I started with pleurotus already but the culture was not succesful due to contamination in the biolab. My aim is to test sound treatment in different fungi species that are good for improving the conditions for plant growth in communal agriculture soil, and soil restoration and remediation in degraded landscapes. Affective rituals: Message as compost \u00b6 The content of the audio in the first experiment iteration was neutral, just pure white noise of 8kHz. In this iteration, I wanted to bring human voice with intentional meaning. I embedded a poem to soil into my technical system. There are restorative effects in humans that emerge from direct contact with soil, and I wonder if expressing our deepest feelings could have an emotional restorative effect as well. Could speaking to the soil as an emotional companion be a form of sonic therapy for humans as well? So I set to record my own conversation with the soil and later transform it into low-frequency audio that I could broadcast to the soil. After all, the sound frequency is targeted to enhance decomposition in the soil. What is a human message that is also compost? What words would I offer as compost? Can I ask the soil to decompose aspects of our modern society/ worldview? In this specific land plot in Valldaura, we are growing medicinal plants. I suddenly thought it makes so much sense to tell the plants roots what I need to heal. So I created a specific poem by combining my notes during my many encounters with the soil in Collserola Park. Some notes were taken on site, some as a posteriori reflection. I have started this way to nurture an emotional entaglement with this plot of land. For the future I would like to collect people\u2019s intimate messages to the soil, whether those are messages for emotional healing or any other thing people want to whisper to the soil.

This time, I soldered the final electronic assemblage and added a bigger speaker. I also changed the generic audio for the audio with my voice. This required sound edition to match the right sound frequencies. I used Sonic Visualiser to visualize the frequency range of my voice audio. The spectrogram shows frequency vs. time, where the vertical axis = frequency, 0 Hz at the bottom, higher frequencies toward the top; and colors show intensity, where green = lower intensity, yellow/orange = stronger The main speech range is from 100 Hz to 4 kHz. The main voice energy has bright bands between 500 Hz and 3 kHz. These are the strongest parts of human speech. The fundamental frequency (pitch) appears around 100\u2013250 Hz, which is typical for normal spoken voice. Higher harmonics and consonants spread from 3 kHz to 6 kHz, these help make speech intelligible. Everything above 8 kHz should be mostly air noise or microphone noise, very little speech energy. After this, I edited the audio in Audacity to better match the desired range of frequency: 0 Hz \u2192 1500 Hz. I removed everything above 1500 Hz and boosted the range of 100\u2013500 Hz Protocol \u00b6 The protocol consists of engaging in both ritualistic and technical steps of communication with the soil. I found myself navigating a web of communication between biological and technological agents. Each transition from one step to the other was a translation from human to digital to biological systems of communication.

They are the background of human activities. Meanwhile in other non-western indigenous traditions mountains are subjects. In Andean worldviews, mountains are apus, spirits, monta\u00f1as sagradas. They are animate, have personality, will and consciousness. People speak to the mountain, a symbolic act that addresses the mountain as a subject with agency. In rituals of Pago a la Tierra, people give offerings to the land: corn, coca leaves, tabaco, animals, to show gratitude or ask for blessings. That is how they enact reciprocity with the land.

From these encounters, I developed two design protocols through post-reflection, which allowed me to articulate early insights into interspecies communication. Building upon them, I later created a third protocol to explore communication with Montju\u00efc, a mountain in Barcelona. Together, these protocols function as both documentation and methodological tools for exploring how humans can engage in interspecies communication with mountains.","title":"Method: first-person research to communicate with the mountains"},{"location":"project/design-studio-1/#protocol-1-mountains-as-kin","text":"In early 2025, I visited the Peruvian mountains connected to my grandparents\u2019 lineages in Satipo (Jun\u00edn) and Huamanga (Ayacucho). These walks were conceived as acts of making kin with the mountains, and of reconnecting with landscapes that are inseparable from my family history. This protocol functions as a ritual of communication intended to remember and re-activate the relationship between my human lineage and the mountains. It begun by visiting landscapes intertwined with family stories, sometimes accompanied by relatives and sometimes alone. A key practice is the conscious recollection of names\u2014of family members and of the mountains themselves\u2014as a way of situating oneself within a lineage that includes both human and more-than-human actors. Upon entering the mountain, introducing oneself is an essential gesture of respect. I then asked the mountain for guidance in unveiling family history. As the walk unfolds, I situated myself within known family narratives and anecdotes while remaining attentive to the unknowns. As we enter deeper into the mountain, we trust we will get answers: emotionally charged encounters with biotic and abiotic elements are treated as messages. Some interactions trigger memories and stories shared by my grandparents; others provoke speculation and imaginative reconstruction. I understand this process as an archaeology of family memory. After sharing intimate and emotional moments with my family, we embraced mountains as kin. The feeling lingers even now. A practice to nurture this connection is talking to my human and mountain ancestors to ask for guardianship. I chose this context as an example of interspecies communication because it is my heritage. The practice of speaking to mountains has been present in my family across generations. On my mother\u2019s side, my grandmother Edith Cebri\u00e1n used to sing to the mountains. At the age of fourteen, she left her life behind in the mountains of Huamanga (Ayacucho) to migrate to Lima, saying goodbye to the land and promising never to return\u2014a promise she kept. In January 2025, some of her descendants, including myself, returned to these mountains for the first time. My grandfather V\u00edctor Moreno maintained a deeply contemplative relationship with the land, often walking and meditating in the tropical mountains of Satipo. It was during one of these walks, on his 56 th birthday, that he died in an accident when a loose tree fell on him. These narratives shape my understanding of mountains not as passive landscapes but as active participants in family history. Migration to the city has distanced my living family in Lima from the land, resulting in the loss of important practices of interspecies communication, such as Pago a la Tierra\u2014an Andean ritual of reciprocity with the land. These visits revealed not only collective histories but also personal insights. The mountains offered responses that I later translated into creative expression, including two poems written during these encounters. Poem for my grandmother Edith. Huamanga Mountains, Ayacucho.

Una mujer muy hermosa, pero muy humilde seg\u00fan la recuerda la memoria familiar. El matrimonio fue mal visto, pero la sentencia llegar\u00eda el d\u00eda del parto de tu hermano. La partera fue amenazada: si atend\u00eda a tu madre, nadie le dar\u00eda m\u00e1s trabajo. No hay poes\u00eda que pueda maquillar la tragedia: Tu madre muri\u00f3 en el parto, y un remolino de dolor se llev\u00f3 a tu padre tambi\u00e9n. Don Pedro se escondi\u00f3 en el alcohol. Semanas despu\u00e9s, en un descuido, muri\u00f3 tu hermano de c\u00f3licos. En el cielo arde tu dolor. \u00bfCual atardecer te vio escapar? Prometiste no volver, pero nosotros hemos vuelto. Volvimos para sentir profundo. Para encontrar la l\u00e1pida de tu padre con su nombre completito; y a tu madre enterrada debajo de la capilla del cementerio, \u201cal fondo nomas\u201d, sin lapida y sin nombre, con su historia an\u00f3nima tambi\u00e9n en la memoria familar \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 mami? Nunca encontramos una foto suya. Mi mam\u00e1 me ha contando, por primera vez, que tu la llamabas Lila. Sonr\u00edo. Es mi color favorito y siempre me rodea.

February, 2025 Victor Moreno naci\u00f3 en La Libertad pero emigr\u00f3 2 veces, la segunda a Satipo. Siempre sent\u00ed la relaci\u00f3n con mi abuelo como intrascendente. El vivia lejos y manten\u00eda una distancia emocional conmigo a la que me acostumbr\u00e9. Pero fue \u00e9l quien me regal\u00f3 mis primeras memorias de la selva. Recuerdo mi primer viaje a Satipo en un bus interprovincial. De un lado, las estrellas a trav\u00e9s de la ventana, y del otro, a mi mam\u00e1 desmoron\u00e1ndose del soroche. Recuerdo el olor a la timolina, y su promesa de que ya vamos a llegar, hijita. Recuerdo despertar y ver esas monta\u00f1as tan verdes por primera vez. Siempre las veo un poco en la memoria. Recuerdo mi incredulidad cuando me dijeron que cruzar\u00eda el r\u00edo en un huaro, una tablita que colgaba de 4 cables de dudosa calidad. Recuerdo el llano m\u00e1s arriba de las monta\u00f1as donde viv\u00eda mi abuelo. Recuerdo secar cacao al sol. Y en las noches, la sopa con yuca frita. La oscuridad profunda. El cielo infinitamente habitado de estrellas. La v\u00eda l\u00e1ctea por primera vez. Lo recuerdo a \u00e9l contando historias a la luz de la vela, historias de esp\u00edritus del monte, de reencarnaci\u00f3n y otros eventos paranormales. Suspendida en sus historias, olvidaba la distancia que el territorio y, quiz\u00e1 mi abuelo mismo, hab\u00edan puesto entre nosotros . Si mi abuelo alguna vez me dio alg\u00fan consejo no lo recuerdo, pero \u00e9l me dio la selva y las noches estrelladas. \u00c9l muri\u00f3 el d\u00eda de su cumplea\u00f1os. Caminaba por su chacra cuando un \u00e1rbol le cay\u00f3 encima. Tan casualmente. Por mucho tiempo cuestionamos esa historia con mi mam\u00e1 \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede caer un \u00e1rbol tan de repente? En febrero del 2025 volv\u00ed a Satipo. Frente a la tumba de mi abuelo, le contaba a un amigo la historia del \u00e1rbol, sin creerla a\u00fan. Al d\u00eda siguiente, me encontraba en una comunidad Ashaninka, cuando un \u00e1rbol cay\u00f3 en el umbral de una puerta que solo segundos antes hab\u00edan cruzado 2 personas. Y as\u00ed, quiz\u00e1 por primera vez pens\u00e9 en mi abuelo de forma trascendente. Sent\u00ed, quiza ingenuamente, pero certeramente, que era \u00e9l, dici\u00e9ndome, hijita ve y cu\u00e9ntale a tu madre que fue un \u00e1rbol, que fue la selva y solo ella que me llam\u00f3 para llevarme adentro. Aqu\u00ed estoy abuelo, pens\u00e9, creo que Satipo me est\u00e1 llamando tambi\u00e9n.","title":"Protocol 1: mountains as kin"},{"location":"project/design-studio-1/#protocol-2-self-transcendence-in-the-mountains","text":"In June 2025, I visited Kyoto and repeatedly hiked Mount Kurama. During these walks, I engaged in interspecies communication by following openly shared cultural practices rooted in Shinto and Buddhist traditions. The protocol was articulated a posteriori and is not intended as cultural appropriation, but rather as documentation of lived experience and recognition that interspecies communication is embedded in many non-Western knowledge systems. In Shinto cosmology, mountains are kamis. Kamis are sacred spirits or divine phenomena inhabiting nature\u2026 the spirits of the mountains, river, ancestors. This understanding resonates strongly with Andean cosmovisions, where mountains are known as Apus. This second protocol centers on nurturing spiritual connection with the mountain through rituals of reciprocity as a form of communication. The trail from Mount Kurama to Kuramadera temple is particularly significant, as it weaves together Shinto and Buddhist practices. Before entering the mountain, I participated in a ritual of water purification, washing my hands and mouth with water sourced from the mountain itself. Before crossing torii gates, I bowed and clapped in prescribed sequences to show reverence to the kamis. Along the trail, I passed through multiple torii gates, some formed by built structures and others by natural elements such as 800-year-old cedar trees. Each crossing marks a threshold between the everyday world and the sacred realm. Upon reaching Kuramadera at the summit, I practiced prayers of gratitude and made offerings, including a poem, before I asked for blessings. This experience reaffirmed my intuition that rituals are powerful entry points for interspecies communication. Rituals are not just symbolic but very physical acts. Every action of washing the hands with water of the mountain for purification, bowing to the cedar trees before crossing their path, is not just a physical engagement but a cognitive commitment to transcend our state of consciousness. Through reverence toward nature, I experienced moments of self-transcendence, not as erasure of the self, but as integration into a larger whole. I also learned that communication implies consent, and that consent may sometimes be withheld. Mount Kurama is known as the birthplace of Reiki, and during one visit I felt compelled to walk a particular trail associated with it. I hesitated and asked for consent at a nearby Shinto shrine and sat on the bark of a tree\u2014where I was immediately bitten by an insect, causing intense pain for hours. I interpreted this experience as a clear response: not today. This moment underscored that interspecies communication is not about control or access, but about listening and respecting refusal.","title":"Protocol 2: Self-Transcendence in the Mountains"},{"location":"project/design-studio-1/#protocol-3-mountains-as-emotional-companions","text":"On September 30 th , 2025, I arrived in Barcelona and felt an immediate pull to visit the closest mountain to my new place of residence: Montju\u00efc. On my very first day in the city, I hiked up the mountain to introduce myself\u2014to the land and to the city. I watched my first sunset in Barcelona from its slopes and asked the mountain for blessings. This initial encounter inspired the design of a specific protocol to explore Montju\u00efc as an emotional companion through repeated visits. The protocol consisted of four hikes conducted over the span of two weeks. It was designed a priori and focused on multisensorial attunement and multimedia documentation. This protocol relies on multisensorial immersion as a data collection strategy. Each visit followed the same observational structure, allowing for comparison across time while remaining open to emergent experiences. The following elements were documented during each hike: -Temporal context: time of day and environmental conditions. -Embodied state: initial and final physical and emotional conditions. -Tactile and olfactory engagement: touching leaves, soil, rocks; noting textures, temperature, moisture, pace, oscillations, pauses, and stops. -Soundscape categorized as: Biophony: sounds produced by living organisms (e.g., birds, insects), Geophony: non-biological natural sounds (e.g., rain, wind), Anthrophony: human-made sounds (e.g., traffic, voices). -Human movement: trail location, directionality, repetition, and morphology of movement. -Linguistic communication: pre-planned speech directed toward the mountain. -Responsive communicative acts: improvised oral or written responses triggered by environmental cues, including memories, emotions, and impulses to express through speech, touch, or poetry. These spontaneous acts were recorded as audio or text. - **Example: Montju\u00efc visit, day 3** - **Initial physical state:** physically exhausted after hiking to Valldaura Labs; still recovering from the flu. - **Initial affective state:** tired, longing for company without conversation; seeking reflection and quiet presence. - **Tactile engagement:** intermittent rain felt on the body; contact with wet leaves, soil, and rocks. - **Olfactory engagement:** smell of rain and wet earth. - **Voice:** poems were recited aloud at the summit and reflections recorded orally; otherwise, silence was maintained. - **Soundscape:** - **Biophony:** birds and insects - **Geophony:** intermittent rain, heavier at the beginning of the hike - **Anthrophony:** traffic noise near the base, fading into quiet at the top, with distant white noise from the city - **Movement:** continuous upward movement along a fixed path\u2014stairs, concrete pathway, soil trail\u2014ending at the highest point aligned with a row of palm trees. - **Speech:** poems recounting my encounters with other mountains I had visited that year - **Final state:** physically tired but emotionally restored","title":"Protocol 3: mountains as emotional companions"},{"location":"project/design-studio-1/#analysis-and-reflection","text":"The third day of visits was marked by doubt. I questioned whether it was worth hiking that day, feeling depleted and unsure of my capacity to be present, similar to meeting a friend when one is exhausted. By the end of the hike, I initially interpreted the experience as non-communicative. However, that same night I woke up abruptly at 4 a.m. with a clear realization: the mountain is a living agentic presence that participates in my emotional life. They are not just objects that help me to represent my emotions, they help me to regulate and transform them. This experience echoed previous moments of nocturnal clarity, most notably after my first visit to Mount Kurama. Recognizing this pattern reinforced my understanding of interspecies communication as something that extends beyond the moment of encounter. With this realization that I can relate to mountains as emotional companions, I approached the fourth visit with heightened intentionality. I explicitly asked the mountain to be my emotional support and gave myself permission to be vulnerable. I arrived emotionally overloaded, unable to tell my emotions apart. During the walk this became clear. Although the trail remained the same, its consistent upward morphology created a sense of emotional momentum. Reaching the summit at sunset initially felt peaceful, yet shallow. Watching airplanes cross the sky triggered my feelings of uncertainty due to my recent relocation to Barcelona: although I had physically landed in Barcelona a couple of weeks ago, emotionally I still felt suspended elsewhere, ungrounded. As darkness fell, uneasiness intensified and culminated in frustration. I allowed myself to release it. In that moment, the mountain became a space where I felt held and heard. I addressed my human and mountain ancestors, asking for guidance, an act possibly prompted by the nearby cemetery. I began moving repeatedly in a triangular pattern shaped by the terrain: a line of palm trees, the cemetery wall, and the site entrance. My pace accelerated in response to resurfacing emotions: restlessness, displacement, lack of belonging. I asked, explicitly, to feel grounded. Gradually, my gaze dropped toward the soil as my movement slowed. Drawn to the center of the triangular space, I noticed tiny mushrooms emerging from the ground, which species I couldn\u2019t identify. In that precise moment, I found a gravitational center in that space and moment, and a sense of being held by the soil itself. My breath eased, accompanied by emotional relief and wonder at life underground. Previous experiences with fungi as metaphors for emotional and ontological processing likely informed the intensity of this encounter. I interpreted this moment as a call from the soil, deeply aligned with my desire for grounding during this transitional phase of my life. Moreover, this protocol highlighted vulnerability as a central condition for interspecies communication. Vulnerability is what renders communication, human and more-than-human, meaningful. Emotional intimacy is not confined to established human relationships; it can emerge with strangers, fleeting encounters, and, as my experience suggests, with mountains. This experience led me to reconsider the premise of my research. Meaningful communication with mountains may have less to do with advanced technologies or sophisticated algorithms\u2014although those have their place\u2014and more to do with cultivating openness and vulnerability. Mountains, as emotional companions, are peculiar beings: vast in scale, shaped by deep geological time, and offering a perspective in which human lives appear fleeting. It is from this temporal and spatial immensity that I sense a form of wisdom in mountains, one that invites humility, grounding, and care.","title":"Analysis and reflection"},{"location":"project/design-studio-1/#personal-manifesto","text":"I understand communication not as an empty exchange of information nor as a purely rational processing of data, but as a reciprocal act that cultivates material, affective, emotional, and spiritual entanglements with the more-than-human world. Communication begins with recognizing the agency of mountains. Mountains are not passive landscapes but living, sensing, and responding presences. I ask for their consent to visit them, and I give my consent to be visited, acknowledging that communication is always a two-way act. I communicate with mountains to remember my kinship with nonhuman beings. Mountains are my ancestors. Visiting them activates autobiographical and family memory, allowing me to feel close to those who came before me. Through speaking with both human and mountain ancestors, I practice guardianship as a shared responsibility across generations and species. I communicate with mountains as an act of deep vulnerability to nurture mutual healing. Mountains are my emotional companions. By offering them my vulnerability, I learn to trust them with my feelings, while also becoming attentive to their own fragility amid anthropogenic disruptions. I receive emotional restoration from mountains, and in return I commit to care for, restore and heal their damaged or threatened landscapes. I communicate to experience spiritual self-transcendence. Mountains are sites of pilgrimage and transformation. Through rituals of reciprocity, they afford transitions into altered states of consciousness, to experience the boundless flow of nature. The sacred emerges through embodied practice, reverence, and sustained relationship.","title":"Personal Manifesto"},{"location":"project/design-studio-1/#ii-prototyping-actions-interspecies-communication-with-the-mountain","text":"__ Conceptual Definition: I want to design an interspecies communication system to engage and practice mutual healing with the mountain interspecies communities, as a radical act of reciprocity. __ Hypothesis 1 : I can embody the stillness of the mountain as a form of human communication.

I want to test what would it be like to communicate with somebody that I already know not with words but with static presence (being present while remaining still or unmoving).

It has been recently studied that soil microorganisms not only emit sound but are also able to listen to it through a mechanisms of mechanoperception, with behavioral impacts. Earthworms, isopods, roots, bacteria, and fungi all respond to mechanical vibrations. For example, I followed a scientific protocol that tested sound at specific frequencies of 8 to 11 Khz to stimulate Trichoderma harzianum, a beneficial fungus that promotes plant growth, nutrient cycling, and pathogen resistance. The treatment with sound increase biomass growth in the fungi. Scientific parameters for sound traits Parameter Based on Robinson et al. (2024) and related literature Frequency range Band-limited noise including frequencies from roughly 4,000 Hz up to 11,000 Hz, centered on 8,000 Hz (4\u201311 kHz bandwidth, 8 kHz peak). Lower frequencies (<1 kHz) travel better in soil but may affect organisms differently; some low frequencies inhibit fungal growth. Sound level Around 80 dB SPL measured near the source. Keep below ~90 dB to avoid adverse effects or soil heating. Duration 30 minutes per day for 5 days yielded clear effects. Continuous 24/7 playback has not been tested and may not be necessary; intermittent exposure appears more realistic and energy-efficient. Signal type Continuous monotone or band-limited noise (not music). In laboratory settings, a pure 8 kHz tone file (\u201ctinnitus masker\u201d audio) was used.

Moreover, can I add other sensors in the soil to expand our hearing capacity? Many soil organisms produce vibrations outside the human hearing range. And beyond expanding our listening capacity, I reflected on how we can become more responsive to the acoustic agency of the soil. While listening to the vibrations of the soil brings to the forefront of our acoustic experience, a world that we have largely silenced and ignored, that is just a first step to nurture soil reciprocities.

It is the soil, but the soil can be understood from different worldviews. In western anthropocentric thought, soil is seen as inert, passive and inanimate object, therefore it is easy to exploit it, to expel it from the city, to pave over it and silence it. This is the dominant narrative and perhaps the root cause of our current global soil crisis. But soil is not inert. It is agentic and alive, and I wanted to focus on getting to know that soil community and adjust my action design to better communicate with that diversity. My collective action objective remained the same: mutual healing. This entails both: emotional restoration for the human subject (me) and ecological restoration for the soil of our land plot in Valldaura Labs. Understanding the ways in which the soil and me are vulnerable was important as a baseline. My disconnection to land has to do with my migration history, that started even before me, with my past generations losing their connection to land to migrate to the capital city in Peru. As a migrant living for 8 years in 3 different European cities in temporal housing, I have lacked opportunities to develop a sense of stewardship for land. That sense of ungroundedness has become stronger in the past year. In a larger scale, I reflected on the current state of soil degradation in the Anthropocene. But specifically, I reviewed a report of \u201cSoil Vulnerability in Catalunya\u201d. There I found that the larger problems of soil degradation in the Catalunya region are agricultural erosion (water/wind) and nitrate pollution. However, in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area the main drivers of soil vulnerability are soil sealing from urbanization and infrastructure, and pollution from extractive activities and landfills. Vulnerability Map: Soil degradation in Catalunya When a connection is broken, everyone suffers from it. And there is no mutual healing without nurturing a healthy human-soil entanglement. Sometimes to start this process we need to find places of biocultural hope. I read that the most biodiverse soil is perhaps situated in more undisturbed sites of the metropolitan area like Collserola Park. Coincidentaly, it was the place that had provided me with the opportunity to care for soil in the past 3 months. As students we were provided a plot of land that we prepared by removing weeds, adding compost, sawing medicinal plants like lemongrass, ruda, calendula, among others and watering. So I continue my experimentation there. For my collective action in Valldaura Labs my aim was to broadcast sounds in the soil that provides a direct stimulation of beneficial fungi and bacterial communities. This would not only potentially increase soil biodiversity but also enhance the conditions for the growth of the medicinal plants of the land plot, further contributing to human healing. I treated the sound frequencies to target insects, nematodes, to beneficial fungi and bacteria. Especially, the Trichoderma fungi that is extremely common and often abundant in compost and healthy garden soils.","title":"Community: soil biodiversity"},{"location":"project/design-studio-1/#echoingsoil-20-collective-action-strategy","text":"In a second iteration of my action, I challenged myself to keep expanding and integrating the ritualistic, affective, scientific, technological dimensions of interspecies communication with the soil in the development of EchoingSoil.

Communication in the soil occurs at low frequencies for organisms such as earthworms, insect larvae and plant roots. While sounds soil mycelium and bacteria emit is less studied, some research suggests they emit and react to low frequencies. Some scientists suggest a fungal response to sound could be increased sporulation. Soil Community Sound Frequency / Notes Earthworms & macrofauna 20 Hz \u2013 1.5 kHz (peaking 100\u2013500 Hz) Insect larvae (chewing, movement) 100 Hz \u2013 3 kHz Plant roots growth Up to 2 kHz Bacterial biofilm (Murphy et al., 2016) Acoustic vibration (50 Hz) enhanced Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation This makes sense because in general soil is a dense, solid, and porous medium that strongly absorbs high-frequency sounds and efficiently transmits low-frequency ones (typically below 2-5 kHz). A study on effective propagation range shows that frequencies below 1 kHz (1000 Hz) travel farthest in soil. In the previous iteration of this experiment, I broadcasted a high-frequency sound of 8Khz to the soil. Perhaps for limited scientific knowledge of soil in the beginning I didn\u2019t realize that sound was only meant for lab settings not for a soil set up. The 8kHz frequency was transmitted to petri dishes of Trichoderma through air not below ground. So, this time the frequency parameter was from 0 to 1500 Hz I also plan to prepare petri dishes with Trichoderma (good for soil fertility) and Pleurotus Ostreatus (good for bioremediation) to test the sound treatment impact on biomass growth.

Can I ask the soil to decompose aspects of our modern society/ worldview? In this specific land plot in Valldaura, we are growing medicinal plants. I suddenly thought it makes so much sense to tell the plants roots what I need to heal. So I created a specific poem by combining my notes during my many encounters with the soil in Collserola Park. Some notes were taken on site, some as a posteriori reflection. I have started this way to nurture an emotional entaglement with this plot of land. For the future I would like to collect people\u2019s intimate messages to the soil, whether those are messages for emotional healing or any other thing people want to whisper to the soil.

This time, I soldered the final electronic assemblage and added a bigger speaker. I also changed the generic audio for the audio with my voice. This required sound edition to match the right sound frequencies. I used Sonic Visualiser to visualize the frequency range of my voice audio. The spectrogram shows frequency vs. time, where the vertical axis = frequency, 0 Hz at the bottom, higher frequencies toward the top; and colors show intensity, where green = lower intensity, yellow/orange = stronger The main speech range is from 100 Hz to 4 kHz. The main voice energy has bright bands between 500 Hz and 3 kHz. These are the strongest parts of human speech. The fundamental frequency (pitch) appears around 100\u2013250 Hz, which is typical for normal spoken voice. Higher harmonics and consonants spread from 3 kHz to 6 kHz, these help make speech intelligible. Everything above 8 kHz should be mostly air noise or microphone noise, very little speech energy. After this, I edited the audio in Audacity to better match the desired range of frequency: 0 Hz \u2192 1500 Hz.

This approach was reflected in the use of undulating lines and mountain-like morphologies in the mold design. This course helped me explore how natural patterns can inform digital fabrication techniques across multiple processes. Laser Cutting \u00b6 For this exercise, we were given a generic box design with the option to personalize the internal walls. We took inspiration from the natural pattern of tree rings and created a section of this geometry using Adobe Illustrator. The design was then further processed in Rhino, where we prepared the file for laser cutting using Rayjet Manager. This step allowed us to translate organic, natural patterns into precise, machine-readable geometries. 3D Printing \u00b6 In the 3D printing exercise, we took inspiration from the morphology of mountains. But instead of opting for a smooth surface, we chose a layered topology inspired by Andener\u00eda Andina, an ancestral Andean agricultural technique that adapts mountainous terrain into terraces to create diverse microclimates. Due to the complexity of this geometry, Rhino alone was insufficient, so we used Grasshopper to generate and control the layered form. The final piece was printed using Bamboo Studio. This was one of my favorite stages of the process, as it aligned with my curiosity about using organic forms for mold-making applications. Molding \u00b6 For the molding exercise, we poured silicone into the box containing the 3D-printed mountain form. Initially, we were concerned that the mold would not capture the finer details of the terrain. However, we learned that silicone is highly effective at reproducing small-scale details. The final mold successfully and accurately reflected the layered mountain geometry from the 3D print. CNC Milling \u00b6 In this exercise, we were asked to create a hollow square as a placeholder for a final object. To maintain conceptual continuity with the previous steps, we integrated the mountain shape into the CNC-milled design. We prepared the toolpaths using RhinoCAM. Among all the fabrication technologies explored, CNC milling was the one I had the least time to fully understand. Nevertheless, I am eager to explore it further, especially because of its potential for creating large-scale molds for biomaterials such as bioplastics or mycelium-based objects. Biomaterials \u00b6 The biomaterials exercise was the most exciting part of the project for me, as I have a strong interest in this field. Ironically, it also proved to be the most challenging. We selected a resin-and-wax-based recipe intended to produce a hard object. Although we correctly scaled up the quantities from a small-scale recipe, our first result did not meet expectations: the material remained sticky and lacked structural solidity. Cleaning the mold afterward was particularly difficult. To address this, we conducted several small-scale tests to better understand the behavior of the material. Through experimentation, we learned how to adapt the recipe for larger volumes. The filler (we used shrimp shells) played a crucial role in providing structural integrity, and although most ingredients were scaled proportionally, the alcohol\u2014which dissolves the resin\u2014needed to be increased only slightly, as excessive amounts made the mixture too liquid. Additionally, allowing the mixture to cool slightly before pouring helped the ingredients integrate more effectively. Finally, we got the desired outcome: the mountain-object in the texture and color of sand dunes.","title":"Fundamentals of Making"},{"location":"project/fundamentals-of-making/#fundamentals-of-making","text":"Throughout the overall design process, we took inspiration from organic forms.

In the echoes of my movement, I hear the mountain\u201d Echoing Branch es is a sculptural extension of the body \u2014 a structure of tree branches that expands my spatial awareness through sound. Each branch acts as an external sensory limb, equipped with contact microphones at its tips. As I move, the branches brush against the environment, picking up subtle vibrations and surface contacts. These mechanical signals are converted into electrical ones, then sonified and transmitted to my skull via bone-conduction transducers. Through this, I perceive the textures and micro-movements of the surrounding space as sound \u2014 experiencing the world\u2019s surfaces and resonances without obstructing my natural hearing. Reflection \u00b6 For some time now, I have been drawn to a curious endeavor: talking to the mountains. But how does one even begin to listen to a mountain? Sometimes nature speaks to us loudly \u2014 birds chirping, frogs croaking, bees humming. But listening to abiotic nature is a challenge. A mountain exists in deep time: static to our perception, immense beyond our grasp. Then it occurred to me \u2014 could movement be a language to communicate with the mountain? After all, movement only emerges through my conscious interaction with the mountain\u2019s morphology. It is a dialogue. The mountain affords my movement. Yet my body feels so small compared to its vastness. I felt the urge to expand \u2014 even if a bit \u2014 the reach of my body. The notion of cyborg offered some inspiration for this experiment. Cyborg art is about creating new senses or expanding the existing ones to better connect to ecologies. My challenge was to develop a sensory prothesis to untap a new channel of communication with the mountain. However, I\u2019ve long felt uneasy about the conventional aesthetics of sensory augmentation that are loaded with electronics, wires, and synthetic materials \u2014 a technological skin that, to me, feels at odds with the organic world I seek to attune to. I wanted to expand my sensory system with natural elements. So I set up to collect fallen tree branches in Poblenou. This was the starting point for Echoing Branches. I attached the branches with a wire so that any person could wear them in the arms, legs (below the knees) and back. I ran some tests in the space of IAAC building (Thanks Ayal for wearing the branches!). And outside in the streets of Poblenou! I extended the reach of my body with the branches. As I walked, I could feel subtle vibrations through the branches \u2014 traces of movement, friction, and contact. Now I am ready for the mountain. But could I go further? Could this tactile sense also become audible? By attaching contact microphones to the branches\u2019 tips, I could translate those vibrations into sound, amplifying the otherwise inaudible interactions between my movement and the mountain. Walking would be transformed by the act of bringing the sounds of the biotic to the forefront of my acoustic experience. Can the sound of the movement tell me something about the mountain? What conversations will emerge? Through the branches of a fallen tree, I expand my hearing. In the echoes of my movement, I hear the mountain Prothesis brief: Becoming the best version of yourself. Inspiration: Becoming a cyborg by Manuel de Aguas, song \u201cVoy Creciendo\u201d by Natalia Doco. Materials: fallen tree branches picked up from Poblenou. Keywords: Listening to the mountain, movement as language, movement to sound, augmenting human senses. Prothesis Two: Mycosensing \u00b6 \u201cWhen I think with fungi, I feel the urge to decompose\u201d Mycosensing is a prosthesis inspired by fungal chemotropism\u2014the ability of hyphae (the growing tips of mycelium) to sense, map, and grow toward their food sources. The device invites us to embody this chemical perception, allowing humans to participate in the fungal act of exploration and decomposition. With Mycosensing, we can help fungi map new landscapes of decomposition within the novel ecologies of cities. The prosthesis detects potential waste materials that could be decomposed by different fungal species and guides the user through vibrational cues that intensify as they approach a suitable substrate. Connected to an online knowledge platform, Mycosensing can also suggest how to prepare the identified waste as a substrate for fungal cultivation and decomposition. Reflection \u00b6 I worked in sustainability science for years, where everyone spoke about societal transformation\u2014yet the visions of \u201cdesirable futures\u201d often felt like a form of escapism. Since I began working with fungi in Berlin, I\u2019ve come to think about transformation differently. Fungi taught me to think about decomposition. Too often, we leap toward utopian futures\u2014blank canvases where the wildest sustainable dreams can be realized\u2014without acknowledging the material consequences of colonialism, industrialism, and capitalism in the biosphere. In the Anthropocene, we live in damaged landscapes, already in decay. As Donna Haraway reminds us, we must stay with the trouble on a planet in ruins. That\u2019s why I see decomposition as a needed metaphor for transformation: it asks us to begin where we are, to give a good death to maladapted systems\u2014from toxic materials to toxic institutions. When I think with fungi, I feel the urge to decompose. Fungi are nature\u2019s alchemists, masters of transformation. I am constantly amazed at the metabolic power. They break down dead matter\u2014from fallen trees to animal remains\u2014returning nutrients to the ecosystem. But what is their new ecological role in this damaged planet, filled with trash and toxic materialities? Fungi did not evolve to decompose these novel materials, and yet, remarkably, many can\u2014experiments show them digesting plastic and even oil. This makes me think that fungi have a new role in the novel ecologies of the Anthropocene. Could I collaborate with fungi, helping them to explore new and potential landscapes of decomposition in the streets of Barcelona? If I were a fungus in the city, what would I want to eat and decompose? But how can I embody the act of decomposing? The first thing that came to my mind was: Well, how does mycelium know where to grow? Fungi don\u2019t have eyes in a traditional sense, but they grow toward their food guided by what they sense chemically. The fungal body, called mycelium, is made up of countless fine threads known as hyphae, which grow outward through soil or organic matter. Each hypha can sense its surroundings using specialized receptors on its cell membrane that detect chemical cues such as sugars, amino acids, and organic acids. When a hypha detects a favorable chemical gradient\u2014like a rising concentration of nutrients\u2014it redirects its growth toward the food source. This reminds me of how plant roots grow toward nutrients. Once it reaches the food, the fungi secrete enzymes into the surrounding material to break down complex substances like cellulose, proteins, or lipids into smaller, absorbable molecules. It\u2019s like an external stomach! Through this combination of chemical sensing, directional growth, and external digestion, mycelium effectively \u201cfinds\u201d and digest food. The most alien thing I can possibly imagine. This is how Mycosensing emerged as a speculative tool for thinking with fungi. I imagined a device equipped with chemical sensors that could scan waste and suggest which fungal species might decompose it. Mycosensing would help me become fungi, or at least act as their representative. After identifying a potential fungal food source, I could take that waste to a biolab and assist the fungi in digesting it, preparing a substrate for mycelium to colonize. So I assembled the prothesis, wore it and tested it. After walking through the streets of Poblenou with Mycosensing, another idea emerged: Wouldn\u2019t it be nice that this prothesis is also a sort of spore-releasing device that matches specific types of waste with the spores of fungi capable of decomposing them? It\u2019s a bit like guerrilla seeding. Guerrilla sporing? Prothesis brief: Becoming something else. Inspiration: Becoming a goat by Thomas Thwaites. Materials: cables, metal grid, plaster bands for arm. Keywords: chemical sensing, decomposing, embodying the fungi. Prothesis Three: It\u2019s all about perception \u00b6 Are we always performing for an eye\u2019s gaze? Playing a role that fits the audience? I was given the unusual opportunity to stage how I would like to be perceived knowing upfront that I was going to be followed and analyzed by a classmate. The only trick: I didn\u2019t know who. I found myself having almost an opposite reaction to creating a mysterious prototype that my classmate would have to overthink and decipher. Given the warning that I will be observed, I decided I just wanted to rest. I followed what my body wanted at that moment: lie down! I had been a intense week. So I climbed up the stairs to IAAC terrace and melted away in a wood bench. It was the perfect spot for looking at the sky, isolating from the crowd behind my headphones and listening to some relaxing tunes of my Spotify. Maybe the bench was my prothesis. A reminder of who I am. Taking care of myself is a priority.Something Ive felt proud of accomplishing in the last years way better than in my 20s. So maybe I was making an statement, that I was tired and it was my time to rest. Of course I had distraction around me, classmates being chatty or showing their prothesis. I was distracted at times, and I did not want to be rude, but I would bring myself to the bench, to defend my right to rest. I also wanted my classmate to just watch me relax and relax too. I think I accomplished that. Later, I was on the other side of coin. Following my subject of observation (Maryam) was equally relaxing. I followed her to the terrace to eat lunch, and we even shared some food. This is how I spent most of the time with her. Not as an external observer, but interacting with her, just chilling. She was carrying around a prothesis which was her own glasses with a picture of an eye on each side. If she wore it, she couldn\u2019t see anything. We, the audience, could see some fake eyes glued to each lens. Open, never blinking. She didn\u2019t wear these glasses during lunch, because it was impractical. But after lunch she modelled them for some of us (she didn\u2019t know I was following her, I think!). Her real eyes were hidden under the prothesis-glasses but somehow, she acted as if she could see us. She became playful and posed for the cameras. I wondered what changes if can hide our eye gazes, who do we become, do we have more permission to be ourselves, or to become a different version? To hide or to let out parts of us?","title":"Living with your ideas"},{"location":"project/living-with-your-ideas/#prothesis-one-echoing-branches","text":"\u201cThrough the branches of a fallen tree, I expand my hearing.

I followed her to the terrace to eat lunch, and we even shared some food. This is how I spent most of the time with her. Not as an external observer, but interacting with her, just chilling. She was carrying around a prothesis which was her own glasses with a picture of an eye on each side. If she wore it, she couldn\u2019t see anything. We, the audience, could see some fake eyes glued to each lens. Open, never blinking. She didn\u2019t wear these glasses during lunch, because it was impractical. But after lunch she modelled them for some of us (she didn\u2019t know I was following her, I think!). Her real eyes were hidden under the prothesis-glasses but somehow, she acted as if she could see us. She became playful and posed for the cameras. I wondered what changes if can hide our eye gazes, who do we become, do we have more permission to be ourselves, or to become a different version? To hide or to let out parts of us?","title":"Prothesis Three: It&rsquo;s all about perception"},{"location":"project/narratives-1/","text":"Narratives I \u00b6 Publication Concept: Soil Reciprocities \u00b6 Core Concept \u00b6 Soil Reciprocities is a publication that explores the dynamic, two-way relationships between humans and the living soil.

Reflections \u00b6 The notion of \u201cbroken machines\u201d is challenged when we learn to dissemble them. Then we start to see multi-functionality and possibilities for alternative uses. Disassembling a 3D printer for resin was a double challenge: On one hand, it involved understanding the mechanics of the printer that I have never used before and was getting to know by looking at all its parts spread on the table. On the other hand, breaking apart a malfunctioning machine is something new to me. But getting to know a machine from the inside, unveiling its mechanical logic, carries a feeling of empowerment. Even simple things like finding out that each part is fed with different voltages was a discovery to me. I enjoyed testing the usability of different components of the 3D printer. I focused on helping to test the motor component that moves a slide in the Z axis of the printer. From testing wiring connections among the Arduino, driver 8825 and motor to testing the code in Arduino\u2026 I grasped and started to how the electronic/digital communication systems of many machines that we use in design work.

Reflections \u00b6 Exploring the potential of the Z axis motor was precisely the starting point for our next exercise, to create a useless machine as the design brief indicated to us. We set ourselves to create a Moody Elevator, a machine that has feelings and is not afraid to express them. Each component from the Z-axis motor, the rails, and even the fan was reconsidered not as a broken piece, but as a potential contributor to a novel purpose. Testing the elevator box and the spinning fan taught us that form and function are inseparable: the fan\u2019s capacity to move weight, and the proportional dimensions of the elevator box, directly informed the design of the 3D printed elevator. Similarly, experimenting with the Z-axis rail to map movements to specific emotional states transformed mechanical motion into expressive language. In this week, I focused on the emotion display panel which made me think about the intimate relationship between technology and expression. We tested two options, OLED and LED, ultimately choosing the 8\u00d78 LED module for its aesthetics. Condensing complex emotions into just eight pixels was a challenge, forcing me to think critically about minimalism and visual communication. Designing the four emoticons and testing them with corresponding buzzer sounds to match the emotional states highlighted how even constrained digital systems can convey rich affective information. We spent at least a couple of hours trying to find the right melodies that were recognizable in the beats format of the buzzer. The imperial march (Star Wars) was my favorite, seamlessly matching the angry emoticon. Each LED lighting up, each short melody playing, gave the machine a personality, moving it from a mechanical device to an expressive entity. The emotion display panel represents the Moody Elevator\u2019s identity, symbolizing how technology can communicate states beyond functionality. Unlike the printer, which communicated through movement and mechanical feedback, the elevator now had a voice and a face, a capacity to interact with users on an emotional level.
